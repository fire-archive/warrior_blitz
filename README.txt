Gameplay:

At the beginning of the game, you choose six units. You can select which kinds and what positions they start in.

You can choose swordsmen, archers, and wizards.

Each level consists of a small battlefield floating in space where you (blue) fight the computer (red) until all of the units on one side are defeated.

Every ten levels, you get to change which units you have.

You start every level with your initial choice of units; units that you lose during a level are recovered on the next.

Swordsmen have the highest health but can only attack hand-to-hand.
Archers have moderate health and can attack from a distance.
Wizards have the lowest health and cast fireballs that deal splash damage.

Levels are procedurally generated, as well.
